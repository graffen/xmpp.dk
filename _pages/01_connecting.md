You can connect to xmpp.dk using your favourite Jabber client.

## To create a @xmpp.dk account
Registration is handled in-band by your Jabber/XMPP client. This is the only way to create an account on xmpp.dk.  
  
Simply add username@xmpp.dk in your client and click “register” or check the box to “create this account on the server” to sign up.

## Connection Information

### Server

* Internet: xmpp.dk
* Tor: mjfjbs3547exsy6r.onion

### Security

* Require SSL/TLS
* When connecting to the hidden service you will get a warning about the TLS certificate not matching the host name. This is OK.

## Secure Communication
The connection between your client and xmpp.net is encrypted using TLS. The server prefers secure connections to other servers, however this cannot be guaranteed. For completely secure end-to-end encrypted chats, you should enable [Off-The-Record (OTR)][off-the-record] in your chat client. 

## Federation
xmpp.dk allows federated connections to all other S2S TLS-enabled Jabber servers so you can chat with anyone that has a Jabber account. Note that Google Talk (has this been deprecated yet?) doesn’t support S2S connections.
