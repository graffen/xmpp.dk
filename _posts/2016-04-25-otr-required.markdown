OTR is now required to communicate through xmpp.dk. If someone attempts to initiate a chat to you without first enabling OTR, 
they will be greeted with the following message:

```For security reasons, OTR encryption is required for conversations on this server```

Once OTR is enabled and you have established a connection, your communication will be secure.
