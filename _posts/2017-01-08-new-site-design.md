title: New site design

I spent the morning implementing a new design for the website.

The design is based heavily (okay, entirely) on the '[Cayman][caymandesign]' design from Github Pages.
I have tweaked a few things here and there but mostly just stuck to what was provided by the Github design.

Hope you like it!
