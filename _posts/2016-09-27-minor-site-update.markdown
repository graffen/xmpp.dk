I added a page with information about the current set of OTR and TLS fingerprints in case you wish to verify the authenticicy of the web site and your XMPP connection. 

I will make sure to update the fingerprints and post on the blog every time the certificates get updated. Since I use LetsEncrypt, the certificates expire every 90 days.
