title: xmpp.dk launched!

For a long time I've been wanting to set up a proper, public and free Jabber server. I've been looking around for a cool and relatively generic domain name for the server and last night I stumbled across the fact that xmpp.dk had been abandoned.  

So I jumped at the chance, and what you're looking at is the result of this. I'll use this blog to post news when stuff happens and to keep you users up-to-date on the state of things. Hopefully I won't be posting a lot though :).

For now, feel free to create an account, add me (details under [Contact][contact]) or any of your friends and start chatting away. 

If you have any wishes or requests, just drop me a line.

Have fun!
