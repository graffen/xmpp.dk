title: IPv6 now supported

When I initially set up this server, I was quite surprised that my provider had stopped supplying IPv6 addresses to new hosts.

But now IPv6 support is back, and I have got an address assigned to this server. Therefore, xmpp.dk and all services on it, are now accessible via IPv6. 

Have a great weekend!
