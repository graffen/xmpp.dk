I've been posting updates about this service on my own personal Twitter for a while but I've decided I need a separate place where
I can report on things like certificate updates, maintenance schedules and the like.  
  
So if you want to stay up-to-date and informed, go <a href="https://twitter.com/{{site.twitter_username }}">follow us on Twitter!</a>
