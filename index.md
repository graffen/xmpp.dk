# Welcome to XMPP.DK
XMPP.dk runs a public, free and secure Jabber/XMPP server that allows account registration. In addition, the server requires OTR to be enabled in your chat client.

* Read [more] about XMPP at [xmpp.org][more]
* There's also a nice [list of clients][clientlist]

There are literally hundreds of public jabber servers out there, so why yet another you might ask? Well, I'm
a huge fan of decentralisation. I believe that communication between individuals should be free and without borders, so setting up a jabber server is my way of supporting this.
