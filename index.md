# Welcome to XMPP.DK

XMPP.dk runs a public, free and secure Jabber/XMPP server that allows account registration. In addition, the server requires OTR to be enabled in your chat client.

* Read [more] about XMPP at [xmpp.org][more]
* There's also a nice [list of clients][clientlist]

There are literally hundreds of public jabber servers out there, so why yet another you might ask? Well, we are
massive fans of decentralisation. We believe that communication between individuals should be free and without borders, so setting up a jabber server is our way of supporting this.
